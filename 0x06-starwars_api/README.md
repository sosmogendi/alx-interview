# Star Wars Characters Project

This project is designed to interact with the Star Wars API to fetch and display information about characters based on a movie ID provided as a command-line argument. The script is implemented in JavaScript and utilizes various web programming concepts such as HTTP requests, API interaction, and asynchronous programming.
