# Pascal's Triangle Implementation in Python

## Introduction
This Python project implements Pascal's Triangle, a mathematical structure that displays a triangular array of binomial coefficients. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two directly above it. This project aims to demonstrate proficiency in various Python programming concepts such as lists, functions, loops, recursion, and optimization techniques.
