# Rotate 2D Matrix

## Project Overview

This project requires implementing an in-place algorithm to rotate an `n x n` 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. The challenge focuses on matrix manipulation and efficient in-place operations using Python.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Matrix Representation**: Understanding how 2D matrices are represented in Python using lists of lists.
2. **In-place Operations**: Minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix in place.
3. **Matrix Transposition**: Swapping rows and columns of the matrix as a step in the rotation process.
4. **Row Reversal**: Reversing each row of the matrix after transposing to achieve the final 90-degree clockwise rotation.
5. **Nested Loops**: Using nested loops to traverse and manipulate the 2D matrix.

## Task

**Function**: `rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)`

- **Prototype**: `def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):`
- **Input**: A 2D matrix represented as a list of lists.
- **Output**: The matrix should be rotated in place by 90 degrees clockwise. The function does not return anything.
